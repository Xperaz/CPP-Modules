# exceptions

provide a systematic, object-oriented approach to handling errors generated by C++ classes. 
Exceptions are errors that occur at runtime. 
They are caused by a wide variety of exceptional circumstance, such as running out of
memory, not being able to open a file, trying to initialize an object to an impossible value, or
using an out-of-bounds index to a vector.

# Why Do We Need Exceptions?
  
  C-language programs often signal an error by returning a particular
value from the function in which it occurred.

One problem with this approach is that every single call to such a function must be examined
by the program. Surrounding each function call with an if...else statement.

The problem becomes more complex when classes are used, since errors may take place without a function being explicitly called. For example, suppose an application defines objects of a
class:
SomeClass obj1, obj2, obj3;
How will the application find out if an error occurred in the class constructor? The constructor
is called implicitly, so thereâ€™s no return value to be checked.
