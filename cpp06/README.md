# static_cast

  1) It performs implicit conversions between types.

        If it is implicit why we use (static_cast) keyword ?

        Because this kind of casting happen at compile time,

        And C style cast is hard to find in code, but you can sreach static_cast keyword

## code example

        int main()
        {
            float   f = 3.5;
            int     a;

            // implicit conversion
            a = f;
            std::cout << a << std::endl;//output 3

            // static conversion => its easy to figure out what type of casting i use
            a = static_cast<int>(f);
            std::cout << a << std::endl;//the seem result
            return (0);
        }

  2) Use static_cast when converesion between types is provided through conversion operator or conversion constructor.

## code example

        #include <iostream>

        class Test
        {
        private:
            int x;
        public:
            Test(int x=0) : x(x)
            {
                std::cout << "conversion constructor" << std::endl;
            }
            operator std::string(){
                std::cout << "conversion operator" << std::endl;
                return std::to_string(x);
            }
            ~Test();
        };


        int main()
        {
            Test obj(3);

            //implicit conversion
            
            std::string str1 = obj;// conversion operator
            obj = 20;// constructor coversion

            // static_cast conversion
            
            std::string str2 = static_cast<std::string> (obj);
            obj = static_cast<Test> (30);

            return (0);
        }

  3) static_cast is more restictive than C-Style

        Example: char* to int* is allowed in C-Style but not with static cast.
        Because char point to one byte, and int point to 4 byte.

## code example

        #include <iostream>


        int main()
        {
            char c;

            int *p = (int *)&c;
            *p = 5; //PASS at compile-time but fail in run time, (that's why it's dangerous)

            int *ip = static_cast<int *>(&c); // Fail at compile-time, because not copatible pointer types.

            return (0);
        }

  4) Static_cast avoid cast form derived to private base pointer.

## code example

        #include <iostream>

        class Base{};
        class Derived : private Base{};

        int main()
        {
            Derived d1;
            
            Base *p1 = (Base*)&d1;//Allowed at compile-time
            
            Base *p2 = static_cast<Base*>(&d1);//Not allowed at compile-time
            
            return (0);
        }

  5) Use for all upcasts, but never use for confused down cast.

        Upcasts, It is the process to create the derived class's pointer or reference from the base class's pointer or

        reference.
        explicit type cast not required in Upcasting (parent_obj = &child_obj)

        The Downcasting is an opposite process to the upcasting, which converts the base class's pointer or reference

        to the derived class's pointer or reference.

        explicit type cast is required in downcasting  (chile_obj = (Child *) &parent_obj).

## code example for up and down cast

        #include <iostream>  
        using namespace std;  

        class Parent {  
            private:  
                int id;  

            public:  
                void showid ()  
                {  
                    cout << " I am in the Parent class " << endl;  
                    }     
        };  

        class Myson : public Parent {  
            public:  
                void disp ()  
                {  
                    cout << " I am in the Myson class " << endl;  
                }  
        };  

        int main ( int argc, char * argv[])  
        {  
            // create object of the Parent class  
            Parent par_obj;  

            // create object of the Myson class  
            Myson my_obj;  

            // upcast - here upcasting can be done implicitly  
            Parent *ptr1 = &my_obj; // base class's reference the derive class's object  

            // downcast - here typecasting is done explicitly   
            Myson *ptr2 = (Myson *) &par_obj;  

            // Upcasting is safe:  
            ptr1->showid();  
            ptr2->showid();  


            // downcasting is unsafe:  
            ptr2->disp();  

            getchar();  
            return 0;

        }  

## code example for the confused down cast

        #include <iostream>

        class Base{};
        class Derived1 : public Base{};
        class Derived2 : public Base{};

        int main()
        {
            Derived1 d1;
            Derived2 d2;

            Base *p1 = static_cast<Base*>(&d1);// OK
            Base *p2 = static_cast<Base*>(&d2);// OK

            //The problem lies here, after type casting we are coming back, when we are back we are just switching
            
            Derived1 *dp1 = static_cast<Derived1*>(p2);// Dervid1 hold derived2
            Derived2 *dp2 = static_cast<Derived2*>(p1);//Dervid2 hold derived1
            
            //this code compiled sucssesfully, but with unwanted values
            //So never use static_cast if you don't know  your pointer is holding
            return (0);
        }

  6) Static_cast should be prefered when converting to void* or from void*.

## code example

        #include <iostream>


        int main()
        {
            int i = 10;

            void *ptr = static_cast<void *>(&i);
            int *ip = static_cast<int *>(ptr);
            std::cout << *ip<< std::endl;
            return (0);
        }


## BOTTOM LINE:

    1. For compatible type conversion, such as float to int.

    2. For conversion operator and conversion constructors.

    3. To avoid unrelated pointer conversion.

    4. Avoids derived to private base pointer conversion.

    5. Use for all up-cast but never use for confused down-cast because there are no runtime checks performed
    for static_cast conversions.
    
    6. Intensions are more clear in C++ style cast (express your intent better and make code review easier).

    7. Finding is easy
   
    8. Error found at compile-time.


# reinterpret_cast

  It is used to convert a pointer of some data type into a pointer of another data type, even if the data types<br> before and after conversion are different.<br>
  It does not check if the pointer type and data pointed by the pointer is same or not.<br>

  ## Syntax :

        data_type *var_name = reinterpret_cast <data_type *>(pointer_variable);

  ## Retutn Type :
    
    It doesnâ€™t have any return type. It simply converts the pointer type.

  
  ## Parameters :
    
    It takes only one parameter i.e., the source pointer variable (p in above example).

  ## Code example :
    
    // CPP program to demonstrate working of
    // reinterpret_cast
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    int main()
    {
    	int* p = new int(65);
    	char* ch = reinterpret_cast<char*>(p);
    	cout << *p << endl;
    	cout << *ch << endl;
    	cout << p << endl;
    	cout << ch << endl;
    	return 0;
    }


  ## Purpose for using reinterpret_cast

    1. reinterpret_cast is a very special and dangerous type of casting operator.
        And is suggested to use it using proper data type i.e., 
        (pointer data type should be same as original data type).

    2. It can typecast any pointer to any other data type.

    3. It is used when we want to work with bits.

    4. If we use this type of cast then it becomes a non-portable product.
        So, it is suggested not to use this     concept unless required.

    5. It is only used to typecast any pointer to its original type.

    6. Boolean value will be converted into integer value i.e., 0 for false and 1 for true.


  ## Program example :

    // CPP code to illustrate using structure
    #include <bits/stdc++.h>
    using namespace std;
    
    // creating structure mystruct
    struct mystruct {
    	int x;
    	int y;
    	char c;
    	bool b;
    };
    
    int main()
    {
    	mystruct s;
    
    	// Assigning values
    	s.x = 5;
    	s.y = 10;
    	s.c = 'a';
    	s.b = true;
    
    	// data type must be same during casting
    	// as that of original
    
    	// converting the pointer of 's' to,
    	// pointer of int type in 'p'.
    	int* p = reinterpret_cast<int*>(&s);
    
    	cout << sizeof(s) << endl;
    
    	// printing the value currently pointed by *p
    	cout << *p << endl;
    
    	// incrementing the pointer by 1
    	p++;
    
    	// printing the next integer value
    	cout << *p << endl;
    
    	p++;
    
    	// we are casting back char * pointed
    	// by p using char *ch.
    	char* ch = reinterpret_cast<char*>(p);
    
    	// printing the character value
    	// pointed by (*ch)
    	cout << *ch << endl;
    
    	ch++;
    
    	/* since, (*ch) now points to boolean value,
    	so it is required to access the value using
    	same type conversion.so, we have used
    	data type of *n to be bool. */
    
    	bool* n = reinterpret_cast<bool*>(ch);
    	cout << *n << endl;
    
    	// we can also use this line of code to
    	// print the value pointed by (*ch).
    	cout << *(reinterpret_cast<bool*>(ch));
    
    	return 0;
    }
