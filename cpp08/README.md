# C++ Templated containers, iterators, algorithms
  The C++ STL (Standard Template Library) is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that      implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures like vectors, lists, queues, and stacks.

  ## Standard Containers

  A container is a holder object that stores a collection of other objects (its elements). They are implemented as class templates, which allows a great flexibility in the types supported as elements.
  
 
  
  ## Container Adapter

  These types of containers are called container adapters. The C++ Standard Library implements class templates such as stack, queue, and priority_queue as a container that puts constraints on the process of storage and retrieval of elements.
