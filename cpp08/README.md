# C++ Templated containers, iterators, algorithms

    The C++ STL (Standard Template Library) is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures like vectors, lists, queues, and stacks.

  ## Iterators

   :point_right: Objects that enable traversal of containers in some order, for eithe reading or writing.<br>

   :point_right: Iterators are defined as templates and muct comply with a very specific set of rules in order to qualify as one of many types of iterators.
